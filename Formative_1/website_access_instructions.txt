The website is hosted using render at the URL above. It is currently on the free tier, and so initial boot up can take up to 30s according to Render.

In the case of a technical difficulty, the code can be run using:

'streamlit run to_do_list_manager.py' 

However, as advised on the previous module, this can result in inconsistent packages and is not recommended.
