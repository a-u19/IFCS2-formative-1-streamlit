A class acts as a blueprint or a template from which objects (instances) are created. It defines a datatype by encapsulating data and the methods that operate on this data into a single cohesive unit. Within a class, variables are referred to as attributes, and functions are known as methods; these define the behavior of the objects spawned from the class.\n\nHowever, direct interaction with a class is not possible; instead, you need to instantiate it, creating an object of the class. In this context, we often say that classes are abstract, representing general concepts, while objects are concrete, embodying specific instances of those concepts.\n\nFor naming classes and objects follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)","block_group":"5fd11567f77a4c92b425d3cb4f9d2e88"},{"cellId":"1f41b2c10f754b03b5218948a12d3e8a","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1695916985958,"execution_millis":19,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"1f41b2c10f754b03b5218948a12d3e8a","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# The Book class is defined here as a placeholder.\n# Currently, it has no attributes or methods (it \"passes\" - does nothing).\n# It can be instantiated, but it won‚Äôt have any functionality \n# until attributes or methods are added to it.\nclass Book:\n    pass","block_group":"0ae4ca274dcc4b9590d33d72d829c881","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"fd155f28a3044722b0500b2014d9ebff","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1695916985959,"execution_millis":25,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"fd155f28a3044722b0500b2014d9ebff","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"Book() # You cannot interact with the class itself","block_group":"0147c4ac6d684232a19e825049ec7725","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"<__main__.Book at 0x7f6ce5420610>"},"metadata":{}}],"outputs_reference":"dbtable:cell_outputs/12836005-cea5-49c9-8d92-b9e423c145b5","content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"4980277c0d0247d18605422cd522f05b","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1695916985971,"execution_millis":25,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"4980277c0d0247d18605422cd522f05b","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"my_book = Book() # creates an instance of class Book","block_group":"d5529ad5989c483f927c84823403a40e","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"7edacf6e37ee44aa90f3a4bfa7e970ea","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1695916985972,"execution_millis":33,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"7edacf6e37ee44aa90f3a4bfa7e970ea","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"class Book:  # Define a class named Book\n    def read(self):  # Define a method named read for the Book class\n        print(\"Reading is fundamental\")  # Print a message when the read method is called\nmy_book = Book() # creates an instance of class Book\n\nmy_book.read() # calls method read defined in the class","block_group":"7edacf6e37ee44aa90f3a4bfa7e970ea","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Reading is fundamental\n","output_type":"stream"}],"outputs_reference":"dbtable:cell_outputs/7296d765-8557-4e42-b835-4c1b97ddb305","content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"fd497ad116c84b5f9cab1fa7fb5ee868","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"fd497ad116c84b5f9cab1fa7fb5ee868","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### üèãÔ∏è Practice Activity 1\n\n1.
