I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good","count":8},{"name":"I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car.

I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector.

I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed …","img_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31e6ElWRymL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-TL-WN725N-150Mbps-Wireless-Adapter/dp/B008IFXQFU/ref=sr_1_10?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-10","_deepnote_index_column":8},{"product_id":"B082LZGK39","product_name":"Ambrane Unbreakable 60W / 3A Fast Charging 1.5m Braided Micro USB Cable for Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops & Other Micro USB Devices, 480Mbps Data Sync, Quick Charge 3.0 (RCM15, Black)","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","discounted_price":"₹199","actual_price":"₹299","discount_percentage":"33%","rating":"4.0","rating_count":"43,994","about_product":"Universal Compatibility – It is compatible with all Micro USB enabled devices, be it an android smartphone, tablet, PC peripheral or any other micro USB compatible device|Unbreakable – Made of special braided outer with rugged interior bindings, it is ultra-durable cable that won’t be affected by daily rough usage|Ideal Length – It has ideal length of 1.5 meters which is neither too short like your typical 1meter cable or too long like a 2meters cable|Supports maximum 3A fast charging and 480 Mbps data transfer speed|6 Months manufacturer warranty from the date of purchase.","user_id":"AECPFYFQVRUWC3KGNLJIOREFP5LQ,AGYYVPDD7YG7FYNBXNGXZJT525AQ,AHONIZU3ICIEHQIGQ6R2VFRSBXOQ,AFPHD2CRPDZMWMBL7WXRSVYWS5JA,AEZ346GX3HJ4O4XNRPHCNHXQURMQ,AEPSWFPNECKO34PUC7I56ITGXR6Q,AHWVEHR5DYLVFTO2KF3IZATFQSWQ,AH4QT33M55677I7ISQOAKEQWACYQ","user_name":"ArdKn,Nirbhay kumar,Sagar Viswanathan,Asp,Placeholder,BharanI,sonia,Niam","review_id":"RGIQEG07R9HS2,R1SMWZQ86XIN8U,R2J3Y1WL29GWDE,RYGGS0M09S3KY,R17KQRUTAN5DKS,R3AAQGS6HP2QUK,R1HDNOG6TO2CCA,R3PHKXYA5AFEOU","review_title":"A Good Braided Cable for Your Type C Device,Good quality product from ambrane,Super cable,As,Good quality,Good product,its good,Good quality for the price but one issue with my unit","review_content":"I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on.
